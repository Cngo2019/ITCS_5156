These are the notebooks for my entire project journey. Sometimes I had to go back and change stuff like showing the numbers, rerunning cells to get different splits, etc.

The notebooks are meant to be run by the number next to them - so 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

# Main Paper:

My method is inspired and influenced by Kwakye and Dadzie's machine learning paper. 

Additionally, I got inspiration from making it into a binary classification problem from Bhuvan's paper (also linked below)

At the end of my report I compared my results against a more modern approach that uses deep learning.
